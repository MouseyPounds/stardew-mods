Details:
[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Plantable Palm Trees[/color][/b] is a SMAPI mod which allows you to plant coconuts to grow palm trees. Planting mechanics mirror that of acorns, maple seeds, and pinecones. Either left- or right-click will work, and hoeing the ground first is only necessary outside the farm. To avoid accidental planting, the mod can be configured to require a keypress as well. This and other options are set in the [i]config.json[/i] file; this file is not included with the download and will be automatically created the first time the game is run with the mod loaded.

[b]Additional Notes:
[/b]
[list]
[*]Because this copies the standard mechanics of other seeds, if you click far from your character while holding a coconut but there is a valid spot right next to your character, a tree will be planted in that closer valid spot.
