Details:
[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Night Market Cat Boat[/color][/b] is a Content Patcher mod which changes the Night Market vendor that sells Seasonal Plants into a Cat and changes the decorations on their boat to include a board game, cheese wheel, and only fish in the bins. All graphics used are based on original game assets. The Cat still sells all the same items and performs animations similar to the original vendor. By default the Cat wears a Sailor's Cap, but this can be turned off in the [i]config.json[/i] file; this file is not included with the download and will be automatically created the first time the game is run with the mod loaded.
