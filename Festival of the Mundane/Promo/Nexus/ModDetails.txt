[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Festival of the Mundane[/color][/b] is a combination SMAPI mod & [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720]Json Assets[/url] Content Pack which changes the Sewer map on the day of Spirit's Eve to a celebration full of Shadow people. There are many costumed Shadows to interact with, a small minigame with prizes, a swimming area, and special hats to purchase. Some of the hats have a side effect which can be quite useful outside of the festival.

[*]Special thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/1949074]hatmouse[/url] for help with initial concepts and support.
[*]This mod was made as part of the [url=https://discordapp.com/invite/StardewValley]discord server's[/url] Fall event, but is opted out of any prize awards for the modding contest.
[*]The mod was created with some help from the Stardew Valley team, but none of its contents should be considered canon.
[*]All mod-added hats are only available for purchase during the festival; they will not show up at Hatmouse's regular shop.
[*][spoiler]The Shadow masks work like the Slime Charmer ring and prevent all damage from Shadow-type enemies in combat.[/spoiler]
