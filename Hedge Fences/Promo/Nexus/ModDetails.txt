[b]Additional Notes:
[/b]
[list]
[*]The fence item will be renamed to "Hedge Fence" and will keep the durability amount of the fence which it replaces; so if you replace wood fences they will decay very quickly and if you replace hardwood fences they will decay very slowly. [i][color=#ea9999]The name change will only apply to items that are newly crafted after the mod was installed; hedge fences currently in the save file will still retain their old name[/color].[/i]
[*]The Hedge Fence will sell for 1g regardless of what they are replacing and what material was chosen. [i][color=#ea9999]The value change will only apply to items that are newly crafted after the mod was installed; hedge fences currently in the save file will still retain their old sale price[/color][/i]
[*]The crafting recipe [i][color=#ea9999]will not change names[/color][/i] and will still refer to the fence that was replaced. This is done to prevent possible issues with the [i]Craft Master[/i]  achievement.
[*]Hedge Fences always craft at a 1:1 rate regardless of what they are replacing and what material was chosen.
