[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Home Sewing Kit[/color][/b] is a combination SMAPI mod & [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720]Json Assets[/url] Content Pack which adds a craftable Sewing Machine and Dye Cabinet so that you can do tailoring at home. The recipes are sold by Robin for 1000g each after Emily has visited you to unlock the Tailoring mechanic. Emily also sends you a mail reminder the next day, but you don't have to wait for it. After crafting and placing the Sewing Machine, interacting with the action button (Right Click for keyboard controls) will bring up the same Tailoring Menu that you get at Emily's Sewing Machine. Similarly, after crafting and placing the Dye Cabinet, interacting with the action button will bring up the "dye pot" menu if you are wearing anything dyeable.
