Event 35

1) change "warp farmer" coords from "12 9" to "13 24"
2) add 3 commands after "doorClose/":
"move farmer 0 -1 0/move farmer -1 0 3/move farmer 0 -14 0/"
3) change "warp Pam" coords from "12 9" to "13 24"
4) move the "move Pam 0 -1 0/" from after "stopMusic" to before it.
5) add 2 more movement commands before "stopMusic" as well:
"move Pam -1 0 3/move Pam 0 -15 0/"
6) a little before the final "doorClose", 2 sets of commands need adjustment. First, between the pair of "pause 500" there are two movement commands ("move farmer -1 0 2/
move farmer 0 1 2/") which must be replaced by a single command ("move farmer 0 3 2/")
7) Then, after the "pause 700" two commands ("faceDirection farmer 2/
pause 500/") must be replaced by a movement ("move farmer 0 13 2/")

Event 36

1) change "warp farmer" coords from "12 9" to "13 24"
2) add a "move farmer 0 -15 0/" just after that warp
3) between "faceDirection Penny 1/" and Penny's 2nd "speak" the command "move farmer -2 0 3/" should change to "move farmer -3 0 3/"
