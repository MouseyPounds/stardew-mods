Details:
[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Floor Shadow Switcher[/color][/b] is a SMAPI mod which allows toggling of shadows on crafted flooring items. It is mostly useful in conjunction with flooring texture replacements such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2726]Natural Paths[/url]. Shadow presence for each flooring item can be set individually in the [i]config.json[/i] file; this file is not included with the download and will be automatically created the first time the game is run with the mod loaded.


[b]Installation:[/b]
[list=1]
[*]Install the latest version of [url=https://smapi.io/]SMAPI[/url].
[*]Unzip the download and place the included [color=#b6d7a8][code]FloorShadowSwitcher[/code][/color] folder into your [color=#b6d7a8][code]Mods[/code][/color] folder.
[/list]

[b]Configuration:
[/b]
The config tokens should be self explanatory. For example, [color=#6d9eeb][b]EnableShadowsForType_0_WoodFloor[/b][/color] lets you enable (set to [i][color=#b4a7d6]true[/color][/i]) or disable (set to [i][color=#b4a7d6]false[/color][/i]) for the crafted Wood Floors (or whatever mod item replaces them.) By default, this mod sets all 10 floors to [i][color=#b4a7d6]false[/color][/i]. In the unmodded game, all items with "Floor" in the name have shadows on.

[b]Compatibility:
[/b]
[b][color=#ffff00]Floor Shadow Switcher[/color][/b] requires [url=https://smapi.io]SMAPI[/url] version 2.10 or higher and should work with Stardew Valley 1.3.36 or higher.
