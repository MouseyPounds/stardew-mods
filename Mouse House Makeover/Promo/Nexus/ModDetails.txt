[b]Configuration:
[/b]
[list]
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]WhichMouseSprite[/b][/color] lets you select who minds the store. The default is [color=#b4a7d6][i]all[/i][/color] which assigns the mice based on the day of the week. A single store minder can be chosen with the other options ([i][color=#b4a7d6]original[/color][/i], [i][color=#b4a7d6]beret[/color][/i], or [i][color=#b4a7d6]glasses[/color][/i]).
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]UseFancyHouse[/b][/color] lets you decide whether Hat Mouse and friends get a fabulous new stone house ([color=#b4a7d6][i]true[/i][/color] - the default) or continue to toil in abandoned ruins ([color=#b4a7d6][i]false[/i][/color]). Also set to false in order to use with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1975]Fixed Mouse House[/url].
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]RecolorOption[/b][/color] lets you change recolor compatibility if not using the fancy house. Default option of [color=#b4a7d6][i]auto[/i][/color] is probably the best choice, but you can force a specific recolor with the other options ([i][color=#b4a7d6]ATDSV[/color][/i], [i][color=#b4a7d6]Ace[/color][/i], [i][color=#b4a7d6]Starblue[/color][/i], or [i][color=#b4a7d6]none[/color][/i]).
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]UseMapPatch[/b][/color] lets you choose whether or not to use a tiny little map merge to fix a missing piece on the right side of the roof. Options are [color=#b4a7d6][i]true[/i][/color] (default) or [color=#b4a7d6][i]false[/i][/color].
