[b]Configuration:
[/b]
[list][*]The standard configuration allows the player to replace as many as four different path items with any of eight different textures. First, the replacement textures themselves are listed:[list][*][i][color=#b4a7d6]None[/color][/i] -- no change; this option lets the player keep the original texture for that item
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]LightGrass[/color][/i] -- matches the lighter grass texture on the farm such as the area above the shipping bin
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]DarkGrass[/color][/i] -- matches the darker grass textures seen most commonly on the Forest/Foraging Farm layout
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]LightDirt[/color][/i] -- matches the common tillable dirt areas of the farm
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]DarkDirt[/color][/i] -- matches the darker dirt textures seen on some maps such as the area in front of Robin's house
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]Pipe[/color][/i] -- a not-quite-natural wide metal pipe
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]Sand[/color][/i] -- matches the sand on the Beach map
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]Straw[/color][/i] -- a texture similar to the vanilla Straw Floor but without the wood underneath; it also has seasonal color changes and the straw shows even when the path is 1 tile wide
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]Shadow[/color][/i] -- a dark translucent texture which has the feel of a shadow
[*][i][color=#b4a7d6]Transparent[/color][/i] -- a nearly invisible texture which allows the player to cover the ground to block seed dispersal without significantly changing the look of the area; it was designed to be just dark enough to see but that visibility depends a lot on what's underneath
[/list]
[*]Nine different flooring textures can be replaced (everything except Stepping Stone Path). Each one can be assigned any of the above textures. Note that the five items which are called "Floor" in the unmodded game have a hardcoded shadow added by the game. These shadows can be removed by using the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3885]Floor Shadow Switcher[/url] mod.

[/list][*]The [i][color=#b4a7d6]LightGrass[/color][/i] and [i][color=#b4a7d6]DarkGrass[/color][/i] textures for Winter are made to look similar to the grass textures of other seasons. However, the farm layouts use smoother snow & ice textures in these areas. The following configuration options let the player override the rough grass textures with those alternatives.[list][*] ﻿[color=#6d9eeb][b]Snow_Overrides_LightGrass[/b][/color] chooses the smoother snowy texture in Winter when LightGrass is in use.
Choices are [color=#b4a7d6][i]true[/i][/color] or [i][color=#b4a7d6]false[/color][/i] (default).[*] ﻿[color=#6d9eeb][b]Ice_Overrides_DarkGrass[/b][/color] chooses the smoother icy texture in Winter when DarkGrass is in use.
Choices are [color=#b4a7d6][i]true[/i][/color] (default) or [i][color=#b4a7d6]false[/color][/i].[/list]
[*]Version 2 adds support for some popular recolors and there are 2 configuration options to control this behavior.[list]
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]Use_Recolor[/b][/color] controls whether the recolor textures should be used. The default is [i][color=#b4a7d6]auto[/color][/i] which will automatically select the Eemie recolor if [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2050]the CP version of Eemie's Just A New Map Recolor[/url] is detected or the Starblue recolor if [url=https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/migrating-xnb-mods-to-content-patcher-packs.141577/page-105#post-3335730]the unofficial CP conversion of Starblue Valley[/url] is detected. These recolors can also be forced via the options [i][color=#b4a7d6]Eemie[/color][/i] or [i][color=#b4a7d6]Starblue[/color][/i] respectively.
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]Eemie_Fall_Variant[/b][/color]  controls whether the Fall paths will match the [i][color=#b4a7d6]green[/color][/i] (default) or [i][color=#b4a7d6]orange[/color][/i] version when using Eemie's recolor.
[/list]
[*]Finally, there are some options which can be set for how the modded items are crafted. [list]
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]Crafting_Material[/b][/color] lets the player choose which material is necessary to craft all modded paths.
Choices are [i][color=#b4a7d6]clay[/color][/i], [i][color=#b4a7d6]fiber[/color][/i] (default), [i][color=#b4a7d6]hardwood[/color][/i], [i][color=#b4a7d6]sap[/color][/i], [i][color=#b4a7d6]stone[/color][/i], [color=#b4a7d6][i]wood[/i] [/color], and [i][color=#b4a7d6]NoChange[/color][/i].The [i][color=#b4a7d6]NoChange[/color][/i] option keeps the crafting recipe unchanged from whatever original item was replaced.[*][b][color=#6d9eeb]Crafting_Amount[/color][/b] lets the player choose how many path items are crafted from each single material.
Choices are [color=#b4a7d6][i]1[/i] [/color](default), [i][color=#b4a7d6]5[/color][/i], or [i][color=#b4a7d6]10[/color][/i].[/list]
[/list][b]
Additional Notes:[/b][list]
[*]The crafting recipe and path items themselves [i][color=#ea9999]will not change names[/color][/i] and will still refer to the item that was replaced. This is done to prevent possible issues with acquiring recipes and awarding of the [i]Craft Master[/i]  achievement.
[*]Footstep & placement sounds are hardcoded based on the original path type and [i][color=#ea9999]cannot be changed[/color][/i] through a Content Patch.
