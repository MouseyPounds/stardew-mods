[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Bear Mounts[/color][/b] is a Content Patcher mod which replaces the horse with a ride-able Bear. Includes 4 different Bear textures (Brown, Black, Polar, and Panda) which are based on the Bear who appears in some cutscene events. Any bear can be ridden with or without a saddle and reins, and a small Stable texture edit which shows more Bear-friendly food choices is included. The choice of Bear and other options can be set in the [i]config.json[/i] file; this file is not included with the download and will be automatically created the first time the game is run with the mod loaded.

Here are some previews of the riding animation and the idle animation with the optional Stable changes.

[b]Additional Notes:
[/b]
[list]
[*]The Bear's animations have been created to work as well as possible with the hat-wearing mechanic. As with the game's default Horse, expect some hats to work better than others.
[*]The Farmer's riding animations have been slightly altered to accommodate the wider Bear.
[*]The icon at the bottom of the inventory menu will also change from a Horse to the chosen Bear.
