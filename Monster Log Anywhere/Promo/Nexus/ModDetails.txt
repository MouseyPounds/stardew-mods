Works with Stardew 1.3

Overview:

Lets you view the Adventure Guild's Monster Kill Log from anywhere with the press of a key.


Details:

[b]Description:

[color=#ffff00]Monster Log Anywhere[/color][/b] is a SMAPI mod which adds a keybind to view the Adventure Guild's Monster Kill Log from any location. It also allows some simple customization of the log's header and footer; the default configuration is more compact so that the vanilla log all appears on one page. The key assignment and text customizations can be set in the [i]config.json[/i] file; this file is not included with the download and will be automatically created the first time the game is run with the mod loaded.


[b]Installation:
[/b]
[list=1]
[*]Install the latest version of [url=https://smapi.io/]SMAPI[/url].
[*]Unzip the download and place the included [color=#b6d7a8][code]MonsterLogAnywhere[/code][/color] folder into your [color=#b6d7a8][code]Mods[/code][/color] folder.
[/list]

[b]Configuration:
[/b]
[list]
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]Monster_Log_Keybind[/b][/color] lets you choose which key to use to open the log. There is a [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings]list of valid key codes[/url] on the wiki. The default is [color=#b4a7d6][i]F6[/i] [/color] and the keybind can be disabled by setting it to [color=#b4a7d6][i]None[/i][/color].
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]Change_Header_and_Footer[/b][/color] lets you choose whether to change the text at the top and bottom of the log or leave it as-is. Choices are [color=#b4a7d6][i]true[/i] [/color](default) or [i][color=#b4a7d6]false[/color][/i].
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]New_Header[/b][/color] is where you can specify the text for the header if changing it is enabled. The default is similar to the vanilla log but adds colored stars and is a little more compact.
[*][color=#6d9eeb][b]New_Footer[/b][/color] is where you can specify the text for the footer if changing it is enabled. The default is similar to the vanilla log but without an initial new line.
